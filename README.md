### Hi there 👋

 - 📗 Studying: EE and compsci
 - 💿 Operating system: Windows 10 (Sorry, I'll probably migrate to Linux🐧 some day. For now `msys` and `WSL` will do)
 - 🖥 Terminal: MinTTY
 - 📝 Editor: Vscode
 - 🎮 Games: Modded Minecraft [Gregtech new horizons], Factorio, Portal, Half-Life series
 - 📘 Currently Learning: L1 certification, pcb design process in Altium

I don't know what else I should put here but it's probably better than just saying "TODO: Write a better description later"
